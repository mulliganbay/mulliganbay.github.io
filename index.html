				<h2>Who is Mulligan Bay?</h2>
				<p>We are real estate professionals looking to invest in raw land all over the United States. We contact local land owners in areas that match our investment criteria.</p>
				<p>We purchase land from people that no longer want it. Most of them feel like the property is a burden, and want to be rid of their annual tax bill and HOA fees.</p>

				<h2>Does this sound like you?</h2>
				<p><i class="material-icons">&#xE616;</i> Did you have plans to retire in this area, but changed your mind and now you feel stuck with your property?
					<br /><i class="material-icons">&#xE7FB;</i> Did you inherit your property, but you have no intention of moving and now you are having trouble selling the property?
					<br /><i class="material-icons">&#xE645;</i> When you bought the property did they promise you that the property area would be developed into something like Palm Springs, but you soon realized that nothing could be further from the truth?
					<br /><i class="material-icons">&#xE928;</i> Are you just holding on to your property because you think selling it is too much of a hassle?
				</p>
				<p>If you are considering selling your property, <strong>WE WANT TO BUY IT!</strong> We are not interested in listing your property for you; we actually want to buy your property now and are prepared to pay you cash for it.</p>
				<p>We buy real estate fast and for cash. We strive to make the sales process very easy for our customers. If you would like to have cash in exchange for your property, please complete our <a href="/sell/">easy offer request form</a>.</p>

				<h2>Does my property qualify?</h2>
				<p>We buy vacant land in almost any condition. Some of our past clients have had property liens, and / or back taxes owed. This is not a deal-breaker for us, but it is very important to disclose on the <a href="/sell/">offer request form</a>.</p>

				<h2>How do I get started?</h2>
					<p>1. Congratulations! Visiting this site is the very first part of the process.</p>
					<p>2. The next step requires a little more information on your property. Our <a href="/sell/">easy offer request form</a> will cover most of the items we need to send you an offer.</p>
					<p>3. We will then review the property information you submit and see if we think it is still matches our investment criteria.</p>
					<p>4. Provided that your property still qualifies, we will send you a free, no obligation, <strong>CASH</strong> offer.</p>
					<p>5. If we can come to an agreement, the closing process starts (we pay associated fees)
The sale closes quickly.</p>
					<p>6. <strong>(optional)</strong> You send a raving review about how fast the process was and how easy we made the process of selling your land for cash.</p>
